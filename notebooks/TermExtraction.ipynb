When you want to appeal to customers with different native languages, use Translation\\n  Workbench to offer translations of store data. When you enable Translation Workbench, you must\\n  provide translations for product data for it to be included in search indexing.Here are some points and recommendations for search and localization in your store., Create Product Data Translations. To offer products in more than one language, you can add translated product names and\\n  descriptions. You can also translate data stored in custom fields with data translation\\n  enabled., Enable Data Translation for Products and Categories.

The products in your store are based on a data object named Product2. The Product2\\n  object serves as a template for all store products. So all Product2 fields are available to all\\n  products in your store. If you add custom fields to the Product2 object, those fields are also\\n  available to all store products. Standard fields and custom field types have characteristics that\\n  affect whether you can control the behavior of search, facet, and display., Considerations for Product Searchability. Here’s a summary checklist of all the things that must be in place to ensure that your\\n  store’s products are discoverable in a search., Set Up a No Search Results Page. When buyers get no results for a product search, they’re redirected to your No Search\\n  Results page. The No Search Results page lets you control your buyer’s no-results\\n  experience.Here’s an example of one way to set up a No Search Results page for a product search., Add Filters (Facets). Buyers use filters—also called facets—to narrow their search results. You\\n  can create filters from product fields, like size, finish, and color. Filters can include\\n  selectable values. For example, let’s say that you have the filter . The\\n    filter takes values, like red, blue, and green. When a filter has\\n  values, they appear on the results page under their parent filters automatically., Mark Product Fields as Searchable. Product fields are consistent from product to product. For example, each product has a\\n  field for Product Name, Product Description, and Product Image. You can use the default searchable\\n  fields or add custom fields to improve search for your buyers. You can also exclude fields so that\\n  buyers can’t discover that information in a search., Mark Products as Searchable or Not Searchable. After you build your initial search index, all products in a catalog are searchable by\\n  default. If you prefer that some products are not searchable, you can exclude any product from\\n  search. Products that are marked unsearchable aren’t returned in search results, though buyers can\\n  see unsearchable products., Set Up and Manage Search. To make and keep your store searchable, perform the following tasks., Add Categories to Store Navigation. By default, store categories are included in the Multi-Level Navigation Menu component\\n  that provides store navigation.

For successful navigation, two things must be in place. Your store must have an assigned\\n  catalog, and you must mark the categories to use for navigation for inclusion on the store’s menu.\\n  The categories that are marked for inclusion appear on the menu by default. Without more work,\\n  each parent category’s related subcategories nest below the parent on the menu. In a B2B store,\\n  the Multi-Level Navigation Menu shows up to five category levels.The data type “Storefront Categories” simplifies the process of showing categories on a menu.\\n   In the B2B Commerce Template, we include the Storefront Categories data type on the Multi-Level\\n   Navigation Menu by default. If you’re creating your own store navigation menu, add the Storefront\\n   Categories data type to it. You can see up to five levels of store categories on the menu., Set Up and Manage Your Store. From Experience Builder, you can configure your store, design store pages, and set up\\n  your store’s navigation. Your store is based on the B2B Commerce template.

With price adjustment schedules, you can offer tiered prices based on the number of\\n  items purchased to give customers who buy in bulk a price break., Set Up Price Book for Original Price. To highlight a discount that you granted to a buyer, you can, optionally, show a\\n  strikethrough price next to the negotiated price. It’s called a strikethrough price because the\\n  value is shown with a line through it. The strikethrough price represents a product’s original\\n  price or manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). You can display this price by creating a\\n  price book for original prices. You can use any price book to display original prices, but we\\n  recommend that you create and label a price book just for this pricing., Create a Pricing Strategy. Within a B2B Commerce store, you want your pricing strategy to be as transparent as\\n  possible.

Lightning B2B Commerce has four types of price books that are used to assign prices to\\n  products in your store.The four price books types available in Lightning B2B Commerce are:, Create a Buyer Group and Associate It with a Store. The only way to make a store’s products visible to buyers is to associate the store with\\n  a buyer group.

Product prices and the products that buyers can access depend on the price books\\n  and the entitlement policies assigned to the buyer group., Allow Buyers to Buy for and Manage Other Accounts with Account Switcher. Allow buyers to switch to other accounts using the Switch Accounts menu item. Authorize\\n  access to allow buyers to manage users from another account and to make purchases on their behalf. , Choose the Product Categories to Use in Breadcrumbs on the Product Detail Page. Left to itself, the order of breadcrumbs is forged from a combination of categories,\\n  products, and the date and time that their association was established. The first association is\\n  treated as the primary one. Breadcrumb order is an automatic byproduct of this association. You\\n  can customize the natural order of breadcrumbs by explicitly identifying categories as primary.\\n  When you identify a category as primary, your store uses it to construct the category path that\\n  populates the breadcrumbs on the Product Detail Page. A product can be associated with multiple\\n  categories, but it can have only one primary category., Add Products to Categories. Add each product in your store to at least one category. In the Product Workspace, you\\n  can select multiple products and add them in one action., Add Media to Products and Categories.

Use the following guide to add the Pricing Workspace to your org\\n  manually. , Use the Pricing Workspace to Manage and Update Pricing.  The Pricing Workspace features the Pricing hybrid list, which allows you to see all\\n  price books or price book entries in your organization act on them. You can filter the hybrid list\\n  to see a specific set of price books or price book entries. For example, filter by a specific\\n  store to see all price books associated with that store. The list can be further customized to\\n  display columns containing information relevant to your organization. , Use the Product Workspace to Manage and Update Products. The Product Workspace features the Product hybrid list which pulls together all of the\\n  products in your organization and allows you to take action on them. You can filter the hybrid\\n  list to narrow down the list to a specific set of products. For example, you can filter by a\\n  specific store to see all of the products in that store. The list can be further customized to\\n  display columns containing information relevant to your organization. , Organize Product Content with a CMS Workspace. CMS workspaces offer a secure environment to organize content into collections.\\n  Designate your store as a channel, so you can share collections of content with other contributors\\n  to the store. You can create and organize collections from the CMS workspace., Get to Know the Workspaces in Commerce.

You might need to make some formatting or style\\n   adjustments.The reference page types and component types from the page-designer-reference repository are\\n   intended to work together, as are the page types and component types included with SFRA.

We improved SFRA support for analytics tracking \"no search hits\" results when the page\\n      cache is enabled. Previously, if page caching was enabled, some \"no search hits\" results were\\n         missed and not tracked. This issue was resolved by adding the  tag to the  template. , Support for Einstein Complete the Set Recommender. SFRA provides a new template that works with Commerce Cloud Einstein’s Complete the\\n      Set recommender.

If your storefront supports multiple regions and languages, you can make sure that\\n    external search engines index your localized pages. Search engines can then show results from\\n    your localized storefront in searches from a supported locale. For each language that your\\n    storefront supports, B2B Commerce for Visualforce can insert an alternate language link in the\\n       of certain pages. The alternate language metadata\\n    supplements the page\\'s canonical URL, which references the storefront guest user\\'s\\n    locale.When you , B2B\\n      Commerce adds the following  metadata in the Home\\n      page, Product List page, and Product Detail page:For example, if your storefront\\'s primary language is English but it also supports Japanese,\\n   the Product List page includes the following metadata:Each  element includes two pieces of\\n   information that identify the locale:The \\n   method returns the canonical and alternate language link values., Canonical URLs for Storefront Pages. Storefront users can arrive at a particular page by following links that use several\\n  parameters, such as locale, query data, and session data. Multiple combinations of parameters can\\n  resolve to the same page. For human users, this practice doesn’t affect their storefront\\n  experience. However, search engine bots evaluate each combination of parameters as a different\\n  URL, and index each URL separately. As a result, search engines can create duplicate index entries\\n  of a particular page, which dilutes your storefront’s SEO ranking. To combat index duplication,\\n  B2B Commerce for Visualforce can insert a  in the  of certain pages. A canonical URL tells search engine bots\\n  the authoritative path of a page, which prevents bots from redundant indexing and boosts your SEO\\n  ranking.For example, the following URL points to the storefront’s Home page:When a buyer visits the page, B2B Commerce appends the locale parameter to the end of the URL,\\n   as follows: Both URLs resolve to the same page. For a buyer, this difference is negligible. However,\\n   specifying one of these URLs as the canonical URL has the following benefits:The version of B2B Commerce that you\\'re using determines how canonical URLs are inserted:, Specify SEO Metadata for Products and Categories.

To attract more traffic to your storefront, serve your product data and other storefront\\n  information directly to search engine bots.

Google Chrome 80, scheduled to be released in February 2020, introduces a new default\\n  cookie attribute setting of SameSite=Lax. Previously, the SameSite cookie attribute defaulted to\\n  SameSite=None. Also new with Chrome 80, when SameSite is set to None, cookies must be tagged with\\n  the Secure attribute indicating that they require an encrypted HTTPS connection. Other browser\\n  vendors are expected to make similar changes soon. To get ready for the changes, enable the global\\n  security preference Enforce HTTPS. Also, test to see if client-side JavaScript code requires\\n  adjustments and to make sure that third-party integrations work as expected.Starting with the B2C Commerce 20.1 Preview Release, we implemented changes to\\n   ensure that cookies behave as expected after the Chrome 80 release. The B2C platform specifies\\n   SameSite=None for cookies from the server. You have to enable the global security preference\\n   Enforce HTTPS so that the server can mark cookies with the Secure attribute and specify\\n   SameSite=None. If Enforce HTTPS is not enabled, the server does not specify the SameSite\\n   attribute. In that case, the browser uses its own default SiteSame setting and might not send\\n   cookies in cross-site contexts. Depending on the significance of the cookie, not sending it can\\n   break critical site functionality. If you are using a B2C Commerce release previous to 20.1 Preview, you can enable the global\\n   security preference Enforce HTTPS to prepare for the changes.We recommend that you test enabling Enforce HTTPS on a non-production instance before\\n   implementing the change on a production instance. We also recommend that you wait until after the\\n   holiday shopping season to make the change.The functionality changes in response to the new Google Chrome SameSite default setting will be\\n   available in B2C Commerce as of January 9, 2020, for the 20.1 GA release, and as of January 16,\\n   2020, for the 20.1 GA Update release.If you set cookies using custom client-side JavaScript, test to determine if your code requires\\n   adjustments to accommodate the Chrome 80 changes. Also, test cross-site scenarios to make sure\\n   that third-party integrations work as expected with the Chrome 80 changes. To enable Enforce HTTPS, in Business Manager, go to . On the Access Restrictions tab, select .\\n   Click .For more information about testing, refer to ., Get Alerts When Two-Factor Authentication Not Enabled for Code Uploads.

After you upgrade the managed package and the available global data, the following\\n      configuration settings are available under the Platform Cache module:For each setting, .Also, B2B Commerce for Visualforce now uses cached category and product data when loading\\n      category and product data, such as on the Product List page. API queries of products and\\n      categories also rely on the cached data.The following global API changes support these enhancements:, Considerations for Upgrading to Product List Page Version 2.0. The Product List page version 2.0 offers several\\n        performance benefits compared to the legacy Product List page version 1.0. However, if\\n        you\\'ve extended or customized the default Product List page version 1.0, migrating to\\n        version 2.0 isn\\'t a trivial project. Review the following considerations to help you decide\\n        whether migrating your extensions is worth the investment., Product List Page 2.0: Efficiently Deliver a Customized User Experience. Show products on the Product List page more quickly, and customize more of the default\\n    Product List page user experience. The Product List page version 2.0 provides better performance\\n    and more built-in extension opportunities than the legacy version 1.0. A new custom object, CC\\n    Product Index, provides a flattened data source for rapidly populating product\\n    results. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. After you upgrade the available global data, the Product List page version 2.0 is\\n      enabled by default. A new configuration setting, Use Version 2.0, is available under the\\n      Product List module.B2B Commerce for Visualforce still supports version 1.0. To help you decide whether to start\\n      using version 2.0 and continue using version 1.0, review the ., B2B Commerce for Visualforce Summer ’18 (Version 4.9) Release Notes. Deliver a faster experience for users on the Product List page, and take advantage of\\n  new performance and security enhancements., Other Fixes in B2B Commerce Spring ’19 (Version 4.10). Have confidence that the issues related to\\n        performance or buyer experience that you\\'ve reported are resolved appropriately. This\\n        release includes several fixes that resulted from your submitted cases., Provide a Localized Admin Experience. For admin users whose Language setting isn\\'t English, B2B Commerce for Visualforce now\\n  provides a localized experience in Salesforce. CC Admin labels, menus, and configuration settings\\n  are now translatable. Outside of CC Admin, B2B Commerce managed package information, including its\\n  custom objects and fields, are also translatable. By default, B2B Commerce for Visualforce\\n  provides Japanese translations, but you can add your own languages. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. For users whose Language setting is Japanese, the translatable items display in\\n   Japanese automatically.For other languages you want to support, use Translation Workbench to provide your own\\n   translations., Account for Changed Default Admin Permission Set. The B2B Commerce Admin permission set no longer includes the Customize Application\\n  permission by default. This change adds a level of security to your org’s data and improves\\n  performance of the managed package. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. If you previously cloned the B2B Commerce Admin permission set, this change does\\n   not affect your clone or any users assigned to it during upgrade.If you assigned the default B2B Commerce Admin permission set directly to users, the managed\\n   package removes the Customize Application from the permission set during upgrade. If your users\\n   require the Customize Application permission, take the following steps after upgrade\\n   completes:, Keep Your Global Data Up-to-Date After Upgrading. Have confidence that your upgrade has completed successfully. B2B Commerce for\\n    Visualforce now checks for missing global custom settings records and configuration settings\\n    when you upgrade. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce checked for missing global custom\\n      settings (such as page labels) as you installed a new version of the managed package. B2B\\n      Commerce automatically reinserted any missing global custom settings during installation.Now, B2B Commerce checks for missing global custom settings when both of the following\\n      conditions are true: and Also, previous versions of B2B Commerce sometimes added new configuration settings in patch\\n      releases, but you had to manually create the configuration metadata in your org. With this\\n      change, clicking  after installing a patch adds new\\n      configuration metadata automatically., Load Global and Storefront Data Separately. To simplify how you load custom settings, custom object records, and configuration\\n    settings, B2B Commerce for Visualforce now loads global data separately from storefront-specific\\n    data. The  page also now accepts a JSON static resource instead of an XML static resource\\n    for both global and storefront data. And, to help avoid any unwanted loss of partial storefront\\n    data, the Delete All button is no longer available on this page. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. If you’re upgrading from a previous version of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, you\\n      still go to  and click .When you install B2B Commerce for Visualforce for the first time in an org, go to  and click  to load only the global data. Then,\\n      use the Load Storefront Data section to select one of the following data sets for a new\\n      storefront:To remove storefront data from your org, use standard Salesforce data management tools, such\\n      as Salesforce Data Loader and Salesforce Developer Experience (DX)., Export Multiple Sites and Locales in a Single CSV Export File. You can now export multiple sites or locales in a single CSV file., Products and Catalogs. Review the new B2C Commerce Products and Catalogs feature in the 20.5\\n  release., Coupon Stacking on Order Promotions. We\\'ve introduced a new promotion preference that controls whether multiple coupon codes\\n  can stack in a single order promotion. This setting impacts monetary discounts only. The\\n  preference defaults to prevent coupon stacking., Control Product Qualification with New System Attribute. Control which products can qualify for your promotions. With this option you can prevent\\n  a product that  already qualified for a higher-ranking promotion from qualifying for your current\\n  promotion. This attribute affects class-exclusive promotions only.You can set this option in Business Manager or through promotion import. Add\\n   <prevent-requlaifying-flag> tag in respective promotion.xml file., Extend Combining and Excluding Promotions with New Attributes. Three new attributes provide you with extended promotion exclusivity and combinability.\\n    To make grouping promotions easier, add promotions to Exclusivity Groups. Then set individual\\n    promotions or entire Exclusivity Groups as Combinable Promotions or Mutually Exclusive\\n    Promotions., Pricing and Promotions. Review the new B2C Commerce Pricing and Promotions features in the 20.5\\n  release., Order Post-Processing APIs No Longer Available. With the release of Salesforce Order Management, you can no longer enable the order\\n  post-processing APIs, including the Gillian package, in the B2C Commerce platform. Customers who\\n  are currently using order post-processing can continue to use it until further notice. This change\\n  does not affect Commerce Cloud Order Management. If you need access to these APIs on SIGs, contact\\n  Salesforce Support., Orders. Review the B2C Commerce Orders change in the 20.5 release, B2C Commerce Business Manager Available in German. The language pack for Business Manager is now localized into 8 languages including French, Italian, Portuguese, \\n  Spanish, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean and for the first time German. In addition, the B2C Commerce release notes \\n  and the release highlights in the Message Center are also available in German., Localization. Review the update to B2C Commerce localization in the 20.5 release., Verify User Permissions for New Stricter WebDAV Unzip Check. A new stricter permission check for WebDAV unzips requires that you check your\\n  configuration to make sure unzip works as expected.B2C Commerce supports an extension to the WebDAV protocol that allows a client to\\n   unzip an archive at the server. With this release, the permission check for WebDAV unzips is\\n   stricter. Previously, when the client was authenticated as a user (not a client ID), you could\\n   unpack a zip file in folders /impex and /impex/src even if files were written to subfolders that\\n   the user didn\\'t have write permission for.Now the write permission on WebDAV paths /impex and /impex/src is strictly interpreted as write\\n   to that folder but not to any subfolders. This new stricter check is consistent with the check\\n   for single files. For each extracted file, the system checks if the user has write permission to\\n   that location. Make sure WebDAV users have write permission to all folders that a WebDAV unzip\\n   must write to. If necessary, grant users write permission to WebDAV path /impex/* or\\n   /impex/src/foldername/*. Note the use of the wildcard * in these paths. You can also move the zip\\n   archive to a more suitable location, or use client ID authentication if more appropriate.To help you identify if the new stricter permission check affects you, we introduced a new log\\n   message to the security logs in Release 20.4. An example of the new log message is as follows:\\n   [2020-03-12 09:11:45.764 GMT] [DW-SEC] User: \\'johndoe\\' (Sites), IP: 136.147.56.1,\\n   [InvalidZipFileEntry] : No permission to extract [src/instance/sample.zip] of [test.zip] to\\n   [/Sites/impex] (in IMPEX), AppServer. Review the new B2C Commerce AppServer feature in the 20.5 release., 20.5 Release. The B2C Commerce 20.5 release occurs April 16, 2020 through May 28, 2020., New Customer Metrics in the Traffic Dashboard. We added new customer metrics to the Commerce Cloud Reports and Dashboards Traffic\\n      dashboard Number of New Customers (Registration) and Total Number of Customers. The new\\n      metrics provide details about initiatives to drive storefront customer registration and the\\n      total number of customer registrations by site or across all sites.  You can filter both\\n      metrics by site and date., Review On-Site Search with the Top Search Dashboard. You can use the new Top Search dashboard to review the search terms customers use on\\n      your storefront and how frequently customers use search.\\n         \\n         You can use the Top Search metrics to evaluate the success of\\n         your storefront search strategy. Use the report to review:  To access the dashboard, click the Top Search tab on the On-Site Search Dashboard., Reports and Dashboards. Review the new B2C Commerce Reports and Dashboards feature in the 20.6\\n  release., Localize Product Tax Classes with the Localized Tax Class ID Attribute. If you operate one site across multiple regions, you can use the\\n      localizedTaxClassId to define different tax class Ids for the same product in different\\n      locales. The new attribute eliminates the need to map a different tax rate for each product\\n      that requires a specific tax handling.\\n         The attribute is a global product preference. To change your system preference\\n         to use the localizedTaxClassId, in Business Manager, select . Check Localized Tax Class for Product. The taxClassId is the default for\\n         SFRA and SiteGenesis sites. , Products and Catalogs. Review the new B2C Commerce Products and Catalogs feature in the 20.6\\n  release., Preassign Components to Regions on Page Designer Pages. When developing a page type or component type, Page Designer developers can preassign\\n      components to regions. When a merchant creates the page in the Visual Editor, the preassigned\\n      components are already in the region. The merchant can remove or modify the preassigned\\n      components as necessary.\\n         Preassigning a region with components makes it easier for a merchant to create\\n         a page. For example, a page layout for a Product List Page can have a preassigned Product\\n         Grid component in the main region of the page. When the merchant creates a page using the\\n         Product List Page layout, the Product Grid is already in the main region. The merchant\\n         immediately knows that the Product Grid component is the appropriate component to use on\\n         the page.\\xa0You can also preassign a Promotional Content component to one of the Product Grid’s own\\n         regions. Populating the Promotional Content component  guides the merchant to use the\\n         component to highlight a particular promotion within the grid of product tiles on the page. Preassigning a Product Tile component to a region within a Carousel component is another\\n         good use case. When merchants add the Carousel component to a page, the Carousel already\\n         contains a Product Tile component, making it clearer to the merchant how to configure the\\n         Carousel.\\n         The developer uses the  property\\n         in the meta definition file for a page type or a component type to indicate which\\n         components are preassigned to a region., Create Templates for Product List and Product Detail Pages. With Page Designer’s new dynamic page feature, you can easily create rich, engaging\\n      templates for Product Detail or Product List pages. You can assign the template to multiple\\n      categories. When a Product List or Product Detail page is rendered in the storefront for one\\n      of the assigned categories, the template page is displayed, populated with the appropriate\\n      product information.\\n         Set up a Product List or Product Detail template page once, with layout,\\n         components, text, and graphics customized for your storefront. There’s no need to create a\\n         separate page for every category. Categories you assign to the template page are\\n         automatically rendered using the template. \\n         Using our new wizard, create the template page using a page layout designated\\n         for Product List or Product Detail pages. Add components to create the look you want. Now\\n         developers can incorporate content in components that’s different depending on which\\n         category is rendered on the page. For example, a dynamic headline banner component displays\\n         the name and image for whatever category is rendered on the page, without any configuration\\n         required. You can override the dynamic content in the component. For example, you can\\n         specify that the headline banner displays a name or image that\\'s different from the name\\n         and image of the category rendered on the page. During page creation or later in Page Settings, assign the template page to one or more of\\n         the categories defined in your site’s catalog.\\xa0, Page Designer. Review the new B2C Commerce Page Designer features in the 20.6 release., Order Export Element Sizes Increased. Version 20.6 of the order.xsd export schema increases the maximum length of product\\n      line item product names, address suites, and applied discount price book IDs.\\n          This change is required to support the integration with Salesforce Order\\n         Management., Orders. Review the B2C Commerce Orders change in the 20.6 release, Check Numeral System Settings for Locales. Locales now correctly display numbers as defined in Business Manager in the locale\\'s\\n      Numeral System setting. Previously, in some cases, the locale used the locale\\'s default\\n      Numeral System even though a different Numeral System was configured in Business\\n      Manager.\\n         It\\'s\\n         possible that some locales that you want to use their default Numeral Systems were\\n         configured in Business Manager to use a different Numeral System. Before this fix, this\\n         mismatch wasn\\'t a problem because the locales used their default Numeral System anyway. But\\n         now locales use the Numeral System configured in Business Manager, which might not be the\\n         one you want.\\n         Check\\n         your locales to make sure that the Numeral System configured in Business Manager is the one\\n         you want to use to display numbers. Go to . Click the locale\\n         name,\\n         and check the setting under the\\n             tab., Locales. Review the new B2C Commerce Page Locales Setting in the 20.6 release., Jobs Automatically Resume After Unplanned Events. If an unplanned event, for example an app server crash, interrupts a job running on\\n      the new job framework, the job automatically resumes. The job step in progress during the\\n      interruption and all subsequent job steps are executed. If the B2C Commerce or custom code\\n      version changed since the job started, the job is restarted from the beginning. If you\\n      restarted the instance or if the app server is shut down as part of a maintenance operation,\\n      the job is not resumed or restarted., Jobs.

Review the new B2C Commerce Einstein feature in the 20.6 release., Guidelines for Category Images for B2B Commerce for Visualforce. Complement your storefront\\'s branded experience with category-specific images that appear\\n    when buyers browse your categories on the Product List page., Organize Products into Categories for B2B Commerce for Visualforce. Organize products into logical categories and subcategories for buyers who prefer a\\n  natural taxonomy of information. You can define multiple levels of subcategories. For example,\\n  coffee products can belong to a Medium or Dark category, and both of those categories can belong\\n  to a parent category named Coffee., Help Buyers Discover Products on Your Storefront. Your storefront is successful only when your buyers can easily find and purchase\\n  products that they\\'re interested in. To support a smooth buyer experience, you can provide\\n  multiple channels throughout your storefront for organizing, filtering, and displaying product\\n  information., Localize Products for an Internationalized Storefront. If your storefront supports more than one locale, localize your product records for each\\n  of your supported languages., Specify Shipping Rates for a Product. During checkout, B2B Commerce calculates the cost to ship an order based on the weight\\n  of items in the buyer\\'s shopping cart. You can specify your own shipping rates and carrier\\n  details. To apply a shipping rate to a product during checkout, add a shipping weight to a product\\n  record., Manage Product Inventory Items and Availability Messages. Build trust with your buyers by providing helpful information about the availability of\\n  products on your storefront. You can manage product inventory with B2B Commerce for Visualforce\\n  custom objects, and show messages about a product\\'s available inventory on the\\n  storefront., Create Relationships Between Products. Maximize the visibility of products on your storefront and promote more traffic within\\n  your storefront by relating products to each other. Entice buyers to purchase add-ons that expand\\n  the capabilities or possibilities of a product they\\'ve already selected. Or, entice buyers to\\n  upgrade a selected product to a newer or more advanced model., Add Documentation for a Product. Some products have accompanying documents that are essential for your buyers, such as\\n  safety and compliance information or performance datasheets. Add these documents as CC Product\\n  Media records., Attach a Product Image Directly to a Record. You can attach an image file directly to a CC Product Media record., Add a Product Image from a Static Resource. You can reference an image file included in a static resource when specifying the image\\n  for a product. You can bundle multiple image files together in a single static resource, and\\n  reference the static resources across multiple records., Add a Product Image from a Content Delivery Network. You can reference an image file served from a central\\n          file repository, such as content delivery network (CDN), using a uniform resource\\n          identifier (URI). We recommend this option for your image files whenever possible because\\n          it\\'s the easiest way to maintain your images from a single managed location., Guidelines for Product Images for B2B Commerce for Visualforce. Enrich your product listings with images optimized for different parts of the storefront\\n    experience. , Create an Assembly Product. If you sell individual products that comprise a larger product, you can also sell the\\n  entire assembled product. An assembly product\\'s price is independent of its component products’\\n  price list items. For example, if your storefront individually sells coffee press parts, you can\\n  sell the fully assembled coffee press at a discounted price., Create an Aggregated Product. Make it easy for buyers to select a particular color, finish, size, or other\\n  characteristic of a product that comes in multiple styles. Manage the specs or other product\\n  details in one aggregated record, but specify a SKU and price for each particular style. For\\n  example, let\\'s say that you sell a coffee press that comes in multiple finishes. You can provide a\\n  single Product Detail page where a buyer can easily select a particular finish., Show All Dynamic Kit Options in a Flow Experience. By default, products in a dynamic kit display on different tabs by product group, so\\n  only one group\\'s products display at one time. Instead, you can change the buyer\\'s experience so\\n  that all product groups appear together on the page. The buyer selects options from a natural flow\\n  of scrolling the page., Create a Dynamic Kit. Let buyers build a custom kit by selecting products from groups of options you provide.\\n  For example, allow buyers to easily select their own coffee supplies by choosing a dispenser, a\\n  grinder, multiple varieties of beans, and any optional accessories. You can require buyers to make\\n  at least one selection from a group, and allow multiple selections from a group. A dynamic kit\\'s\\n  price is the sum of the price list items for whichever component products the storefront user\\n  selects., Create a Kit. Combine two or more existing standard product SKUs into a single purchasable item. A\\n  kit\\'s price is always the sum of the component products\\' price list items. By default, a kit can\\'t\\n  include an exclusive item that isn’t available outside of the kit., Create a Bundle. Combine two or more existing standard product SKUs into a single purchasable item. A\\n  bundle\\'s price is independent of its component products’ price list items. For example, if your\\n  storefront individually sells multiple types of coffee beans, you can group several varieties\\n  together and sell the bundle at a discounted price. A bundle can include an exclusive item that\\n  isn’t available outside of the bundle., Create a Product for Your Storefront. For a product sold by itself, setup is easy. Don\\'t worry about composite products or\\n  component products—create just one product record with all the details., Types of Products for B2B Commerce for Visualforce. A product on a B2B Commerce storefront can range from a single physical item to multiple\\n        items bundled and sold together. For the items you’re selling, choose the product\\n        configuration that best suits your storefront users’ shopping experience., Set Up Product Data for B2B Commerce for Visualforce. Products are the reason why buyers visit your storefront, create accounts, and make\\n  purchases, and why they return frequently to make new purchases. To that end, create product data\\n  in your org that is rich with details like media and performance or measurement\\n  specifications., Migrate Configuration Data Between Orgs. Most B2B Commerce solutions rely on multiple orgs for developing, testing, debugging,\\n    and deploying their storefronts. Generally, you want to propagate the same configuration\\n    settings from one org (such as a sandbox org) to another (such as a production org). You can\\n    export configuration records and use the Data Loader client application to upsert the records in\\n    a new org., Build, Activate, or Deactivate a Configuration Cache. Build and activate a new configuration cache, which is a collection of indexed\\n    configuration settings, whenever you change global or storefront configuration settings. B2B\\n    Commerce for Visualforce uses the most recent, active cache to quickly access configuration data\\n    when loading storefront pages. Each configuration cache includes settings for all of your\\n    storefronts, even though you often manage configuration settings at the storefront level. You\\n    can also deactivate, reactivate, and remove old configuration caches., List of Configuration Modules and Settings. , Manage Configuration Settings. Control most default display, layout, and other user experience decisions for your\\n  storefront pages using configuration settings. In CC Admin, you can define global configuration\\n  setting values that apply default behavior to all of your storefronts. Tailor individual\\n  storefront experiences by overriding specific settings per storefront. Configuration modules\\n  gather settings into logical groups for a simpler admin experience.The configuration information that you manage in CC Admin represents records of several B2B\\n   Commerce for Visualforce custom objects:, View Page Keys. B2B Commerce for Visualforce defines a set of keys that provide programmatic short names\\n  for all pages included in the managed package. For reference, you can find the list of default\\n  page keys in CC Admin.In CC Admin, select  from the Global Settings menu to view the\\n   list of page keys defined for the storefronts in your org.Use a page key when assigning a page for global or storefront-specific configuration\\n   settings.When you create a custom subscriber page, you can add a unique key to this list for your\\n   subscriber page. You can use the subscriber page key to assign configuration settings to your\\n   page. B2B Commerce for Visualforce uses the page key in URLs for your page., Storefront General Settings. Set important names, domains, search metadata, behavioral flags, and other baseline\\n    values for the storefront., Admin Experience: More Easily Manage Storefront Data in Your Org. Equip your admins with better tools for managing your org\\'s B2B Commerce for Visualforce\\n  data. Simplify the process of setting up new storefronts and upgrading to new releases or patches.\\n  And, admins whose native language is Japanese can now enjoy a more efficient experience with a\\n  localized CC Admin., Invoke Apex Callouts When Removing a Stored Payment. You can now perform an Apex callout when you extend the default functionality for\\n        removing a stored payment on the My Account page. Previously, attempting a callout from an\\n        extension to  resulted in an exception. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This change removes the database savepoint from . The extension class method  now includes the\\n                                 and  statements for DmlException\\n                        instances.To migrate your subscriber code, update any extensions of the  method to\\n            either:, Set Private Properties on the ccrz.cc_CallContext Object. Salesforce API changed to strictly enforce private properties on objects. As a result,\\n        B2B Commerce for Visualforce now requires any subscriber code that directly sets properties\\n        on the  object to instead use\\n        appropriate initialization methods. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Migrate any subscriber code that directly sets properties on the  object to use the  and  methods.For example, let’s say that your subscriber code directly sets a property:Update your code to use the \\n      method:, Account for Changed Default Guest Permission Set. The default permission set assigned to storefront guest users adds access to the\\n    Visualforce page. This change helps ensure a consistent and\\n  uninterrupted storefront experience for unauthenticated users. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. If you previously cloned the default guest user permission set—which was\\n   named CloudCraze Guest in previous versions—edit your cloned permission set. Include\\n     in the Enabled Visualforce Pages list.If you start using the B2B Commerce Guest permission set for new implementations, this\\n   permission is already added—no extra setup is necessary., Easily Activate Shopping Carts When Adding Items with the API. When you programmatically add items to an inactive shopping cart using the  method, B2B Commerce for Visualforce\\n    now automatically enables the cart\\'s Active Cart field. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This change applies to both version 2.0 and 1.0 of the Shopping Cart page. In previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, an inactive cart remained\\n      inactive when items were programmatically added to it. This change reduces the complexity\\n      required to activate a cart when adding items. This change applies to all  calls where the input maps specify  and later.If you call this method in your subscriber code and you use the \\n      notation, make sure that you update your code to account for this change.If you prefer to continue using the previous behavior of this method, make sure that your\\n      subscriber code specifies \\n      or earlier., Control How Frequently the Shopping Cart Reprices Items. Gain even more precision over your Shopping Cart page performance by fine-tuning how\\n  frequently B2B Commerce for Visualforce calls pricing logic on cart items. No matter which version\\n  of the Shopping Cart page you’re using, you can specify how B2B Commerce compares two new fields:\\n  the cart’s Repriced Date and the storefront’s Valid Prices Date. A new configuration setting in\\n  the Cart module, Optimize Cart Repricing, provides options for how B2B Commerce evaluates these\\n  fields. Find the right combination for your storefront, and multiply the improved performance you\\n  gain from other Shopping Cart enhancements. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This change applies to both version 2.0 and 1.0 of the Shopping Cart page. In previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, each time a buyer visited the\\n   Shopping Cart page, B2B Commerce called pricing logic to reprice all cart items.This change improves Shopping Cart page performance by skipping the pricing logic under certain\\n   conditions. A new field on the CC Cart object, Repriced Date, specifies the date and time that\\n   B2B Commerce most recently priced the cart items.

A small green circle\\n         is displayed near the preview icon. , Create Custom Page-Level Attributes. Developers can define attributes for page types. For example, a developer can create a\\n      page type that includes attributes for the Title, Image, and Description displayed in search\\n      results for the page. Or the developer can define page attributes for page tags that allow\\n      merchants to search, sort, and retrieve pages more easily.\\n         The developer includes page-level attributes in the JSON meta definition file\\n         for a page type.

Dynamic pages are typically implemented as Product List or Product Detail pages for\\n      which the content changes based on which category or product is rendered. With this version,\\n      you can create and manage these pages more efficiently.\\n         When you open a dynamic Product List page, a category is now preselected in\\n         the preview settings and rendered in the page. Typically, the first category assigned to\\n         the page is selected. Previously, you had to go to the preview settings and select a\\n         category. If no category is assigned to the page, or if a page uses product as its dynamic\\n         attribute, you must configure a setting in preview.For Product List pages, or other dynamic pages for which the dynamic attribute is category,\\n         you can specify when components appear on a page based on the category rendered. For\\n         example, you can specify that one component appear on the page when the men’s clothing\\n         category is rendered and a different component appear for women’s clothing. To configure\\n         component visibility, the merchant selects Targeting in the component drop-down and then\\n         chooses one or more categories.

Previously, different folders, instances, and\\n      environments used different file retention periods or no retention period at all. The new\\n      retention logic will be enabled after the 20.7 release. Download and save files you want to\\n      retain for longer than the new retention period.\\n         During the transition to the new retention logic, some instances will have\\n             and  folders that\\n         contain the files to be deleted for 30 days. You can recover files from the\\n             folders during that 30 days.\\xa0Adjust your configuration so\\n         that you don\\'t depend on the files in the _trash folders since those files will be removed\\n         in a future release.The new retention periods are as follows:To avoid performance and stability problems, you can’t store more than 100,000 files in a\\n         folder. If there are more than 100,000 files in a folder, files are deleted starting with\\n         the oldest first even if the files are newer than the retention period for the folder. The\\n         100,000 limit applies to files in one specific folder, not across subfolders., Monitor Browser Access Patterns and Unexpected Changes. You can use the method  to specify a\\n      response header of Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only for storefront requests. \\n         The Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only response header instructs browsers to\\n         report violations of a policy to a specified URI. Depending on your policy, it\\'s possible\\n         to have many violation reports. You must direct the reports to an external system that is\\n         not B2C Commerce, typically a third party. Information about policy violations can help you\\n         understand browser access patterns and detect unexpected changes that are possibly the\\n         result of malicious actors., AppServer.

The pricing engine then\\n         calculates and returns the price per unit (PPU) via the following APIs:We don’t currently support the ability for the merchant to directly input the PPU from an\\n         external source. Although PPU can be shown as a product attribute in search results or on\\n         product list page (PLP), sorting and filtering by PPU is not currently supported. This\\n         functionality will be available in the Commerce API in a future release.

You can use any decimal number less than 1, for\\n         example,\\n         0.5 or 0.3, but you can\\'t use negative numbers. To increase the relevance of attribute\\n         text, specify a boost factor greater than 1.0. For example, specifying a boost factor of\\n         2.0 makes the field twice as relevant in relation to other fields in the index.Include the boost factor value in the page or component meta definition file, as in the\\n         following example:, Page Designer.

Deliver a better experience to your buyers when they begin typing in a storefront search\\n    field and see a list of suggested results. When you use the Product List page version 2.0, B2B\\n    Commerce for Visualforce now returns autocomplete suggestions with a SOSL query of your product\\n    index records. With this change, search autocomplete and the Product List page can reference the\\n    same data source, which results in fewer database queries for your storefront. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This change only applies to storefronts using the\\n   Product List page version 2.0. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce returned search autocomplete\\n      results by executing a SOQL query of your product data. This design could negatively affect\\n      performance because it searched multiple database tables. After you upgrade the managed package, this change is available automatically if\\n      you\\'ve enabled the Product List page version 2.0.If the Product List page version 1.0 is enabled, autocomplete still uses a SOQL query of your\\n      product data.If you previously extended the \\n      class to override the default SOQL query for populating autocomplete suggestions, this change\\n      doesn\\'t conflict with that customization. Evaluate performance of the new implementation and\\n      determine whether it can meet your needs., Account for CSR Permission Set Changes. The B2B Commerce CSR permission set that the managed package installs now includes\\n    updated Visualforce page access, object settings, and Apex class permissions.

This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. If you previously cloned the default B2B Commerce CSR or CloudCraze CSR permission\\n      set, update permissions on the cloned permission set:To grant permission for activities that CSRs perform on behalf of community users, update the\\n      custom community user profile assigned to your registered storefront users.

Use the following metadata XML examples to help you programmatically deploy the required\\n  sharing rules for maintaining your storefront\\'s guest user access., Deploy Storefront Sharing Rules Metadata Programmatically. If you manage multiple storefronts and communities, creating sharing rules for every\\n    affected B2B Commerce custom object across every community can be a time-consuming task. To more\\n    efficiently deploy sharing rules to all of your communities, you can programmatically deploy\\n    sharing rules metadata through a command-line tool., Create Sharing Rules for Guest User Access to Storefront Objects. A guest user isn\\'t just a real human that\\'s browsing your storefront but hasn\\'t\\n    registered for an account. The managed package includes code that executes in the context of a\\n    guest user, such as an Apex class that rewrites URLs to make them human-readable. You previously\\n    restricted guest user access to records by default, which was a required security measure. To\\n    ensure that a B2B Commerce guest user (human or otherwise) can still access your storefront,\\n    create sharing rules for only the necessary objects., Configure External Sharing Settings for Storefront Users. To make sure that your buyers can successfully access your storefront\\'s content, set up\\n    the appropriate sharing settings. These settings grant the minimum access necessary for certain\\n    B2B Commerce for Visualforce custom objects, which power your storefront\\'s content and\\n    experience.

To verify or troubleshoot\\n  permissions for community users, check for the correct permissions, Apex class access, and\\n  Visualforce page access on your community user profile., Assign Permissions for Storefront Community Users. Recall that, before you installed the managed package, you created a custom community\\n    user profile for your storefront\\'s registered users. The profile provides access to the Apex\\n    classes, Visualforce pages, and other resources that provide a smooth storefront experience for\\n    buyers. Associate that profile with your community\\'s members so that when a user registers on\\n    the storefront, they become a community member and inherit the profile., Assign Permissions for Storefront Guest Users. A community automatically creates a profile that\\'s applied to a user who visits the\\n    community but hasn\\'t logged in to an account. B2B Commerce for Visualforce provides a default\\n    permission set that provides a starting point for restricting guest user access to your org\\'s\\n    data. To help keep your storefront secure against unauthorized access, verify some settings on\\n    the guest user profile and apply the appropriate permissions., Configure the Storefront Secure Domain.

This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This change only applies to storefronts using the\\n   Product List page version 2.0. In previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, the CC Product Index object\\n      collated product data for displaying results on the Product List page version 2.0. The CC\\n      Product Index object included lookup relationships to relevant products and categories, and\\n      referenced date and sequence fields from those records. This design caused database table\\n      joins that sometimes affected performance when loading content on the Product List page. The CC Product Index object now includes fields copied from relevant CC Product, CC\\n      Category, and CC Product Category records when the product index is built:The  class is updated to include\\n      these new fields on the CC Product Index object.

Reduce the potential for content cloaking, which can affect your storefront\\'s search\\n  ranking. The bot-enabled Product List page now sorts products by the same default criteria that\\n  you specify for sorting results on the standard Product List page. With this change, human users\\n  and search engine bots experience the same content, which better aligns with search engine\\n  guidelines. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. In previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, products on the bot-enabled\\n   Product List page sorted only by Sequence, regardless of the standard page\\'s default sort option.\\n   If you specified any default sort option other than Sequence, human users and search engine bots\\n   experienced different content on the Product List page., Deliver Better Semantic Tagging on the Product List Page. Boost the search ranking of your Product List page showing category results in external\\n  search results. The Product List page now contains the correct semantic hierarchy of heading tags.\\n  This change helps increase the authority of the page and allows search engine bots to more\\n  accurately crawl the content on the bot-enabled Product List page. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. When you upgrade the managed package and enable bot detection, this change is\\n   available automatically on the bot-enabled Product List page.If you\\'re not using bot-enabled pages, the tags are available in both version 2.0 and 1.0 of\\n   the Product List page served to human users., Provide Cleaner URLs with Fewer Parameters. To reduce the number of URL variations that search engine bots encounter on your\\n  storefront, B2B Commerce for Visualforce now removes certain parameters from page URLs. This\\n  change improves the efficiency of bots crawling links on your storefront and simplifies the\\n  browsing experience for human users. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. The following parameters previously used in Product List page and Product Detail\\n   page URLs are deprecated and no longer included in any URLs:If any of the following parameters are empty, B2B Commerce for Visualforce no longer includes\\n   it in a URL: After you upgrade the managed package, this change is available automatically., Control the Specific HTML Served for Bot-Enabled Pages and Components. Fine-tune the HTML output of the searchable content served directly\\n   to search engine bots that are crawling your storefront pages. You can create your own\\n   Visualforce pages and components for serving bot-enabled content, and override the default\\n   bot-enabled pages and components that B2B Commerce provides. Ensure that search engines crawl the\\n   exact semantic content that you want them to see. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce didn\\'t provide any override of\\n   the default bot-enabled pages or components, other than the values of certain  tags. After you update the available global data, the following storefront configuration\\n   settings are available under the User Interface module:For each of these settings, enter the name of your custom Visualforce page or component.

This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce didn\\'t include promotions content\\n   on bot-enabled pages. Promotions add value-rich content that contributes to the search ranking of\\n   your storefront\\'s pages. When you upgrade the managed package and enable bot detection, your existing\\n   promotions are included in your bot-enabled pages automatically. No extra setup is necessary.For details about which promotion configurations are supported in bot-enabled pages, check out\\n   the bot-enabled page help., Serve Home Page Content to Search Engine Bots More Efficiently. To make it easier for search engine bots to crawl and index your Home page, B2B Commerce\\n  for Visualforce now serves a bot-enabled Home page. Also, the Home page canonical URL is\\n  simplified. These changes improve the efficiency of search engine bots crawling your storefront,\\n  which ultimately helps boost your storefront\\'s search ranking. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Because previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce did not serve a\\n   bot-enabled Home page, search engine bots tried crawling the standard, asynchronously loaded Home\\n   page. As a result, content on your Home page could be : bots could\\'ve indexed\\n   a version of your Home page with different content than what human users saw.In addition, the Home page canonical URL previously included the page name:Since  is , the URL\\n     also resolved to the same page as\\n    .To simplify the canonical URL presented to search engines, B2B Commerce for Visualforce now\\n   removes the page name from the Home page URL.  When you upgrade the managed package and enable bot detection, the bot-enabled Home\\n   page is available immediately. No extra setup is necessary.To use the new canonical URL, set the Enable Canonical and Alternate Language Links storefront\\n   configuration setting to . This setting is available under the User\\n   Interface module., Add SEO Support for All Regions and Languages. Make it easier for search engine bots to crawl and index your localized Home page,\\n    Product List page, and Product Detail page. B2B Commerce for Visualforce now complements the\\n    default-locale canonical link in a page’s  with\\n    locale-specific alternate links. With this change, search engines can show your localized page\\n    content in search results for the languages and regions your storefront supports. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This metadata is included on the Home page, Product List page, and Product Detail\\n      page for guest users, including bots. B2B Commerce for Visualforce already serves localized\\n      content to authenticated storefront users based on their locale. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce included a canonical link in the\\n         of the Home, Product List, and Product\\n      Detail pages. Because the canonical link value didn’t include any language-specific\\n      information, the canonical link always resolved to content in the storefront’s default\\n      language.With this change, you can better support the external search experience of your target locales.\\n   For example, if your storefront supports Japanese, you can make sure that search engines index\\n   the Japanese versions of your pages. Then, a user in Japan can find search results from your\\n   storefront in Japanese. After you upgrade the available global data, a new storefront configuration\\n   setting, Enable Canonical and Alternate Language Links, is available under the User Interface\\n   module. By default, this setting is . To start inserting\\n   alternate language links, change this setting to .After you enable the configuration setting, the following  metadata is inserted:For more details, check out the help for alternate language links in your storefront pages.The  method supports this change.\\n   Previously, this method returned only the URL value for a page’s canonical URL. Now, this method\\n   returns the URL values for a page’s canonical URL and alternative language links for any selected\\n   storefront languages. If you previously created subscriber code to extend this method, update\\n   your code to account for the new returned information, if necessary., Include Locale in Canonical URLs. To support search engine bots crawling and indexing your multilingual storefront, B2B\\n  Commerce for Visualforce now includes the storefront guest user\\'s locale in canonical URLs. The\\n  guest user\\'s locale corresponds to a search engine bot\\'s locale. This change helps search engines\\n  understand the authoritative version of your storefront content, even when you support multiple\\n  regions and languages. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce didn\\'t provide any locale\\n   information in support of storefront SEO. This change complements other changes in this version\\n   to add locale-specific alternate links in page metadata. In previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, canonical URLs were inserted\\n   automatically into the  tag of the Home, Product\\n   List, and Product Detail pages.After you upgrade the available global data, a new storefront configuration setting, Enable\\n   Canonical and Alternate Language Links, is available under the User Interface module. By default,\\n   this setting is . To continue using canonical URLs after you\\n   upgrade the managed package, change this setting to .After you enable the configuration setting, your canonical URLs include the parameter\\n     , such as\\n   .For example, before you update the managed package, the canonical URL in a Product Detail page\\n   uses the following format by default:The new canonical URL path includes the\\n     parameter:In addition, sitemaps also use the updated canonical URL values.The  method supports this change.\\n   Previously, this method returned only the URL value for a page’s canonical URL. Now, this method\\n   returns the URL values for a page’s canonical URL and alternative language links for any selected\\n   storefront languages. If you previously created subscriber code to extend this method, update\\n   your code to account for the new returned information, if necessary., SEO: Enhance Your Global Search Strategy. Align your storefront with more search engine guidelines, further reduce content\\n  cloaking, and include more search-optimized data with only a few clicks. Add visibility for all\\n  the locales your storefront supports, and let search engine bots easily crawl and index\\n  locale-specific content. Serve more semantic content directly to search engine bots, or customize\\n  the bot-enabled pages to suit your specific requirements., Reorder Widget: Give Buyers a Shortcut for Repeating a Previous Order. Give buyers a shortcut for quickly placing a new order based on a\\n   previous order. When you enable the Reorder widget for your storefront, a buyer can see up to\\n   three of their most recent orders at a glance. With a single click, the buyer can start a new\\n   shopping cart based on one of those recent orders. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. The Reorder widget provides Visualforce storefront parity with the B2B Commerce\\n   Reorder Lightning component in Experience Builder. After you upgrade the available global data, a new storefront configuration\\n   setting, Enable Quick Reorder Widget, is available under the Reorder module. By default, this\\n   setting is . To add the Reorder widget, change this setting to\\n    ., Google Analytics: Easily Track Storefront Activity. Using clicks, not code, you can easily track storefront activity,\\n      including pages viewed, errors encountered, orders placed, and more. Connect a Google\\n      Analytics™ account to your B2B Commerce for Visualforce storefronts, and easily view, measure,\\n      and analyze your storefront activity from your Google Analytics console. You can optionally\\n      mask IP addresses and track user-specific activity across devices and browser\\n    sessions. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce didn\\'t provide any default\\n   integration with Google Analytics. This change adds support for the following metrics across your\\n   storefronts: From your Google Analytics console, create a property for each storefront that you\\n   want to track. Add the property\\'s Tracking ID to your storefront using the Google Analytics\\n   Tracking ID configuration setting, which is available after you upgrade the managed package.Other new configuration settings are also available after you upgrade the managed package:, Lightning Components for B2B Commerce for Visualforce: Create Storefront Entry Points with Experience Builder. Add commerce capabilities to your Lightning community with B2B\\n      Commerce components in Experience Builder. These components show data from a B2B Commerce for Visualforce storefront directly on your\\n      community’s pages. The components also link to pages on your Visualforce storefront, which\\n      helps provide a smooth user experience between your storefront and your\\n    community.\\n  This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This change provides a way to use both a Lightning community and a Visualforce\\n   storefront together in the same B2B Commerce implementation. However, there are some important\\n   caveats: After you upgrade the managed package, the following Lightning components are\\n   available in Experience Builder under the\\n   Custom Components section of the Components panel:If you have an existing storefront built on Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce, you can start using\\n   these components by switching to a Lightning template., B2B Commerce for Visualforce Summer ’19 (Version 4.11) Release Notes.

This\\n        release includes several fixes that resulted from your submitted cases., Provide More Reliable Keyboard Navigation for Guest Buyer Checkout. Deliver an uninterrupted checkout experience for a storefront guest buyer, regardless of\\n  whether they click the UI or use keyboard buttons to navigate the checkout flow. This release\\n  fixes an issue where pressing Enter (Windows) or Return (macOS) on the Process Payment button\\n  during checkout invalidated the cart and reset checkout. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. This issue caused the guest buyer to have to repeat all steps of the checkout flow\\n   again—a poor and time-consuming experience. Now, a guest user pressing Enter or Return on\\n   the Process Payment button successfully continues to the next step of checkout. After you upgrade the managed package, the default Visualforce component for\\n   processing purchase order payments, , is\\n   updated with better handling for keyboard focus. If you haven\\'t extended or overridden this\\n   component, your checkout experience is ready to go.If you\\'ve extended or overridden ,\\n   update your subscriber code to include a  element\\n   that contains both the Purchase Order field and the Process Payment button. Make sure that the\\n   form\\'s ID is ., Maintain JavaScript Libraries That Affect the Storefront Buyer Experience. Have confidence that your buyers\\' browsing experience is smooth and safe across all pages\\n    and components on your storefront. This release updates several of the third-party JavaScript\\n    libraries that B2B Commerce for Visualforce references by default when rendering front-end\\n    behavior. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. The updated libraries include: After you upgrade the managed package, the  extension class references these updated libraries\\n      by default. To start using the updated libraries on your storefront, build and activate a new\\n      configuration cache.If you  extended this class with subscriber code, this update doesn\\'t break any\\n      existing functionality on your pages. If you  previously extended the default\\n         class, update your\\n      subscriber code so that it references the latest versions of these libraries. If you reference\\n      these libraries from other locations in your code, update those references, as well.Also, if you previously extended either of the following default Visualforce components,\\n      there are some important manual updates:These components called functions from the unversioned\\n         library. Complete the following updates:, Automatically Set Sharing Settings for Storefront Community Users. Keep your new storefront data more secure by default, and get started with new\\n  storefronts more quickly. An improvement in Salesforce Spring ’20 allows managed packages to set\\n  external sharing settings for custom objects. As a result, B2B Commerce for Visualforce now\\n  automatically sets the organization-wide default (OWD) external access sharing settings for its\\n  custom objects during installation. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Before Salesforce Spring ’20, you had to manually update the OWD external access\\n   sharing settings for B2B Commerce for Visualforce custom objects in each storefront that you\\n   created.This change ensures that the OWD external access remains Private—the most\\n   secure—for as many B2B Commerce for Visualforce custom objects as possible. As a bonus,\\n   this change also helps save you time each time you set up a storefront. If you\\'re upgrading from a previous version of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, this\\n   change doesn\\'t affect OWD external access sharing settings that you\\'ve already set. No extra\\n   action is required. We recommend that you take the opportunity to review your existing sharing\\n   settings and ensure that they\\'re as restrictive as possible.For new installations of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, the managed package automatically sets\\n   the OWD external access for the following objects to :This access is specified using the following field in each object\\'s metadata XML:, Comply with Communities Security Alerts for Guest User Access. Ensure that your Communities data is secure by default, yet continues to support the same\\n  storefront experience for unregistered users that you currently provide. Several Communities\\n  security alerts disallow guest user access by default, which affects storefronts where guest users\\n  can browse, create carts, check out, and self-register. This release contains fixes that ensure\\n  that guest users can continue to self-register and create carts, and provides resources for you to\\n  work around other restrictions. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. These alerts are automatically enabled with the Salesforce Summer ’20 release and\\n   become mandatory with the Salesforce Winter ’21 release. If you\\'ve already resolved these\\n   security alerts for a previous version of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, you can relax! No extra\\n   action is necessary after you upgrade the managed package.If you haven\\'t resolved these alerts yet, we recommend that you complete the required steps as\\n   part of your upgrade. The specific security alerts that affect guest user access on a storefront\\n   include: To resolve these security alerts for your B2B Commerce  for Visualforce solution,\\n   complete the steps in .You can create subscriber code that allows a guest user to create, read, update, or delete\\n   (CRUD) records, even after you\\'ve completed the security alerts. After you upgrade the managed\\n   package, the following new static methods are available on the  base class:Each method accepts either a single sObject or a ., Trust: Keep Your Storefront Secure and Functional. Keep your storefront, community, and org up to date with the latest measures to protect\\n  against unauthorized access. Ensure that your storefront continues to provide a smooth, engaging,\\n  and intuitive experience for buyers., Metrics: Automatically Track Usage-Based Entitlements for B2B Commerce for Visualforce. Gain insight into your storefronts, orders, and products activity. B2B Commerce for\\n    Visualforce now reports metrics information in the Usage-based Entitlements related list, which\\n    you can find under Company Information under Setup. There’s no extra setup required to access\\n    this information. This change applies to all versions of the B2B\\n      Commerce for Visualforce managed package in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic in\\n      Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Usage-based entitlements are available for all production orgs that have B2B\\n      Commerce for Visualforce installed, regardless of your installed version. The following usage-based entitlements are available, depending on which B2B\\n      Commerce license type you\\'ve purchased. The Allowance column shows the amount of each\\n      entitlement provisioned for your org.If you have the B2B Commerce Starter, Growth, or Plus license, the following usage-based\\n      entitlements are available:If you have the B2B Commerce Platform (legacy) license, the following usage-based\\n      entitlements are available:, Provide a Native Language Experience for French and German Admins. For admin users whose Salesforce user language is set to French or German, B2B Commerce\\n  for Visualforce now provides a localized experience. CC Admin labels, menus, and configuration\\n  settings are now available in both languages by default. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. For users whose Language setting is French and German, the translatable items\\n   automatically display in the correct language automatically.For other languages you want to support, use Translation Workbench to provide your own\\n   translations., Quickly Identify and Track Your Changed Configuration Settings. Keep your configuration cache history organized by adding a detailed label to each cache\\n  entry that you build. That\\'s right—you no longer have to remember which cache entry\\n  corresponds to which set of configuration settings. Now, you can add a remark—up to 255\\n  characters— to each cache entry so you can quickly test, revert, or troubleshoot changed\\n  settings. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. After you upgrade the managed package, the Configuration Cache Management page of\\n   CC Admin Global Settings includes a new column, called Label. Click the label text field next to\\n   a configuration cache record, and enter a description of the changes you made. Click the\\n   checkmark  to save your text as the new label., Admin Experience: Manage Storefront Metadata More Efficiently and Confidently. Equip your admins with better tools for managing B2B Commerce for Visualforce data.\\n  Support development and troubleshooting efforts with more context for multiple configuration cache\\n  entries. And, admins whose native language is French or German can now enjoy a more efficient\\n  experience with a localized CC Admin., Build Product Index Records Faster. Simplify the burden of maintaining your storefront by refreshing your storefront\\'s\\n  product data more quickly. Now, you can split the Apex batch jobs that generate product index\\n  records into separate parallel threads. You can execute up to five batch jobs in parallel, which\\n  ensures that you can generate new product index records faster and more efficiently. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. By default, the product index build executes batch jobs consecutively in a single\\n   thread. Each job class runs one after the other until the thread is complete. For orgs with large\\n   amounts of products and price list items, building product index records using this single-thread\\n   approach can take a substantial amount of time.With this change, you can split the batch jobs into parallel threads, up to five at a time.\\n   This change allows admins to take advantage of existing Salesforce functionality in support of\\n   B2B Commerce for Visualforce storefronts, and provides finer control over specific resources. After you upgrade the managed package, the Refresh Product Index section of the\\n   Indexing page in CC Admin Global Settings contains a new option. Select the number of parallel\\n   Apex batch jobs—one to five—that you want to use for refreshing the product index\\n   records.To support this enhancement, the  utility class in the B2B Commerce API includes a new\\n   method, ., Exclude a Product from the Product Index Build Job. Manually control whether a specific product is discoverable from search results or\\n  category results on the Product List page, even if the product is otherwise eligible. For the\\n  products you want to exclude, the product index build job doesn\\'t create any product index\\n  records. This enhancement gives merchandisers another option for managing the product catalog, and\\n  helps admins reduce the time required to build product index records. As a bonus, this change can\\n  also help reduce the overall data footprint of product index records. This change applies to  in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\\n      in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. In previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce, a product was included in the\\n   product index build job if the product met the following criteria:Aside from these criteria, B2B Commerce for Visualforce didn\\'t provide a way to manually\\n   exclude eligible products from the product index build job.With this change, you can prevent an otherwise eligible product from appearing in search\\n   results or category results on the Product List page. The product still has a Product Detail\\n   page, and you can link to the product from a promotion or a Related Products page section.For example, maybe you don\\'t want buyers to find the individual component products of a bundle\\n   or dynamic kit from a search or category. But, you do want buyers to find the bundle or dynamic\\n   kit. In this case, you can exclude the component products, but leave the composite product\\n   available. After you upgrade the managed package, the CC Product object includes a new\\n   field—Exclude from Product Index. Enable this field for any product that you want to\\n   exclude from the product index build job, the Product List page, and category tree., Product List Page: Manage Product Index Records More Efficiently. Maintain the product data used for populating results on the Product List page more\\n  easily, and deliver up-to-date content for your buyers with fewer dependencies. Optimize how B2B\\n  Commerce for Visualforce runs batch jobs for refreshing product index records, and exclude certain\\n  products from being indexed., B2B Commerce for Visualforce Spring ’20 (Version 4.12) Release Notes. Provide your merchandisers and admins with more tools for managing your product catalog\\n  and storefront metadata with greater efficiency. Apply important security and behavior\\n  enhancements that keep your storefront secure, compliant, and running smoothly., Page Designer. Review the new B2C Commerce Page Designer feature in the 20.9 release., Retrieve Cart Information and Order History Data for Externally Authenticated Shoppers. The Shop API Customers resource now has the  endpoint for creating an external profile.\\n         When using an external identity provider (IDP) such as Google or Facebook to\\n         authenticate shoppers, B2C Commerce stores an external profile for each shopper. The\\n         external profile allows for retrieval of shopper data such as cart information and order\\n         history., OCAPI.

After an administrator configures these settings, the option to\\n         revert the settings is no longer visible on the Access Restriction page. Only Salesforce\\n         Customer Support can revert the settings., JavaScript Not Supported in HTML Attributes. For security reasons, support for JavaScript in a database object’s HTML attributes is\\n      discontinued. We’re implementing this change over several releases. Beginning with this\\n      release, Business Manager users can no longer embed JavaScript in HTML attributes. But during\\n      a transition period, Business Manager users with strong authentication, such as through\\n      multifactor authentication with Account Manager, can embed JavaScript in HTML attributes.\\n      Also, a Business Manager user with strong authentication can temporarily allow users without\\n      strong authentication to include JavaScript in HTML attributes.To temporarily allow users without strong authentication to include JavaScript\\n         in HTML attributes, the strongly authenticated Business Manager user goes to  and clicks .

To see payment details for an order, including payment types, methods, amounts, and\\n  transaction details, open the order payment summary record., Payments and Invoices. The authorization, capture, and reconciliation of customer payments occurs as orders\\n  move through specified stages in the fulfillment workflow. Your Salesforce admin can automate\\n  payment capture, invoice generation, and refund processing to help manage all of your payment\\n  transaction needs.Your Salesforce admin determines the timing of these steps. For example, you can authorize\\n   funds when a customer submits an order, and then capture funds and generate an invoice when the\\n   order is fulfilled.To help you manage payment transactions, Order Management creates an order payment summary for\\n   each order. Unlike the order summary, an order payment summary doesn’t represent an original\\n   record and changes to it. Instead, it represents a set of payment records that use the same\\n   payment method and are associated with an order summary. Payment details from the associated\\n   payment records dynamically update the order payment summary, which makes it easy to understand\\n   and work with an order’s balances across multiple payments, including authorization, capture, and\\n   refund amounts., Create a Process Exception. Create a process exception to manage a processing issue that is not automatically\\n  identified by your order management processing business logic., View Process Exception Details. A process exception record contains details about the root cause of the processing\\n  failure that created the exception., Process Exceptions. A process exception occurs when there is a processing failure on an order summary and a\\n  separate process is required to resolve the issue before order processing can\\n  continue.Order Management lets you automate order processing across every stage in the order lifecycle.\\n   However, there are key steps in the order lifecycle during which failures—process exceptions—can\\n   occur and interrupt order processing. Process exceptions can include failed fraud checks or payment captures, lack of available\\n   inventory, and issues with shipping carriers.When a process failure occurs, Order Management creates a process exception and generates a\\n   process exception notification that displays across the top of the order summary page. Processing\\n   on the order summary can’t continue until you resolve the issue. You can see a list of all order summaries with process exceptions by selecting the Process\\n   Exceptions list view page from the Navigation bar. Select a record to see details for the process\\n   exception., View Fulfillment Locations. Fulfillment locations identify the physical locations from which order product items are\\n  fulfilled, such as warehouses and retail stores., Update Shipping Details for a Fulfillment Order. Update shipping details for a fulfillment order to change the fulfillment location,\\n  shipping method, or shipping address., Remove an Item from a Fulfillment Order. Remove an item from a fulfillment order to cancel the fulfillment process for the\\n  item., Update the Status of a Fulfillment Order. Update the status of a fulfillment order to move the order from one stage of the\\n  fulfillment process to another., View Order Fulfillment Details. To see details, shipping addresses, and statuses for the order products and quantities\\n  assigned to a fulfillment order, open the fulfillment order record., Order Fulfillment. The order fulfillment process streamlines the allocation, assignment, picking, packing,\\n  and shipment of order items to help you provide a superior shopping experience for your\\n  customers.Order Management includes an unmanaged package containing sample flows and processes. The\\n      samples demonstrate how you can create a fulfillment process to allocate order items to a\\n      fulfillment location and generate a fulfillment order. Your Salesforce admin can use Flow\\n      Builder to modify and extend the sample flows and processes to progress orders, from creation\\n      through fulfillment, payment, and shipping, based on your company’s business requirements. As\\n      an alternative to Flow Builder, your Salesforce admin can configure fulfillment processes by\\n      using Salesforce APIs and Apex custom code. Other admins can create custom approval processes\\n      for things such as fraud checks and manual order reviews. Your Salesforce admin can customize the default fulfillment statuses to match the steps in your\\n      company’s fulfillment process.You can track the status of a fulfillment order by viewing its status on the associated order\\n      summary, or by opening the fulfillment order record., View Order Summary Information. To see details, fulfillment status, payment information, and historical activity for an\\n  order, open the order summary for the order., Order Summary. An order summary is a comprehensive, historical snapshot of an order that pulls together\\n  all order details into a single, consolidated view. It can help you manage and service\\n  orders—before, during, and after fulfillment.An order summary is more than an order record. It is a tool that helps you manage the entire\\n   order lifecycle and deliver superior service to your customers.When a shopper submits an order from an ecommerce storefront, the details of the order\\n   transaction are transmitted to Order Management. The order capture triggers the creation of two\\n   data objects—an order and an order summary. The order, which represents the original order\\n   transaction, becomes the foundation of the order summary.At this point, all information in the order summary matches the information in the order, the\\n   order is locked, and all subsequent order activity is tracked using the order summary.Order Management creates other types of order objects to represent specific order elements,\\n   such as products, payments, and shipping. In addition, any substantive changes to an order, such\\n   as a cancellation or return, generate a change order object. As an order moves through the stages\\n   in the order lifecycle, data from these objects dynamically updates the information displayed on\\n   the order summary so that you always have a current view of an order’s status.You can access the records represented by these objects from links provided on the Order\\n   Summary page in the Order Management Console., Customize the Order Management Console. Modify settings in the standard Order Management Console to make the console your own.\\n  Configure custom tabs and fields, and modify page layouts and components to make it easier for\\n  users to find the information that they want., View Records in the Order Management Console. Your order records display in a list view format in the Order Management Console. List\\n  views are a great way to sort, prioritize, and analyze the records that are most important to\\n  you., Order Management Console. The Order Management Console shows all your customer order information at a glance. It\\n    includes tools that help you manage and service orders throughout the order lifecycle. You can\\n    customize the console to make it your own.The Order Management Console is the first thing you see when you log in to Order Management.\\n      The Order Summary page is the primary workspace in the console.Here’s the Order Summary page in the Order Management Console., Considerations for Deleting Order Management Records.  Certain situations require that you delete Order Management records. For example, some\\n  Order Management records can contain customer personal information, and are subject to data\\n  protection and privacy regulations. To maintain data integrity, your data deletion procedures must\\n  consider dependencies between these records and access restrictions on some of their\\n  data., Order Management Shopper Records. Order Management uses the Account and Contact objects to represent business and\\n    individual shoppers. It can also use Person Accounts to represent individual shoppers. When it\\n    receives an order, it searches for the shopper in the system. If it finds the shopper, it\\n    associates the order with the existing records. If not, then it creates records for that\\n    shopper., Order Management Objects. Order Management objects, together with existing objects, represent the elements of an\\n    order as the order progresses through the order lifecycle. , Order Lifecycle Management. Use Order Management to automate and manage the order lifecycle from order capture\\n  through fulfillment, shipping, payment processing, and service.To get you started, Order Management provides sample flows and processes that demonstrate a\\n   basic order workflow from start to finish. Your Salesforce admin can modify and extend the sample\\n   flows and processes to meet your company’s requirements. Your admin can also use Salesforce APIs\\n   and Apex custom code to configure your fulfillment workflows.The basic order workflow moves an order through the following stages.As an order moves through these stages in the Order Management app, all activity associated\\n   with the order is reflected in the order summary record. You manage an order throughout the order\\n   lifecycle by using the order summary record and the tools provided in the Order Management\\n   Console., Create B2B Commerce Buyer Experiences.
